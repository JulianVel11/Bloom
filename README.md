Bloom is the first test of a page that came up to my mind after learning the basics of Grid.
I have a lot of ideas for this page that I cannot do right now due to my lack of knowledge on javascript however, as I continue to get better and learn more I will be updating this page.
I want this page to do many things like the content to move upwards every time a link on the nav is clicked so the page stays on the same spot, also add animations to the text to help fill the silly and empty design, maybe making some flowers pop up on the screen.
If some one see this and has some comments on how to improve the design or code you can reach me at ...
